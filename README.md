# pytorch_dataloader
I load my data using these data loaders


1. Start From DataLoader title
2. you will get train, test and val sets
3. All sets are scaled using stardard scaler (I found not useful some cases)
4. We have basic ANN model
5. We can also use standard X,Y split and load the data from there
6. I have obtained both scaled and unscaled data which I find more useful to train both and see the results
7. We have training loop
8. We can also save the model
9. Get train and test accuracy
